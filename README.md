# Atari-10K

Very much a work in progress.



Changes done to the text versions of the manuals:
- shorten it as much as possible via proper formatting (i.e. removing unnecessary indentation and line breaks)
- properly labeling all figures

TODO:
- For each manual, create a sub-folder containing the relevant figures, as well as a json with detailed captions for each figure.
- In the text version of each manual, reference the figure number (corresponding to the externally labeled image and json caption)
- double check that all game versions match those in the gymnasium environments
- for each game, create a small document pointing out which game-mode is used (the manual usually explains a number of different ones) and how the described controls translate to the one the AI is able to use.
