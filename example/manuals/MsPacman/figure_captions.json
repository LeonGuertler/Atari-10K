    "Figure1": "A vibrant illustration from the Atari 2600 Pac-Man manual featuring a playful depiction of the game's characters. In the foreground, we see three colorful ghosts, one pink, one blue, and one red, surrounding a jovial, round orange Pac-Man character with blue eyes and rosy cheeks. Pac-Man seems to be happily interacting with the pink ghost. The maze-like game board stretches below them, dotted with small pellets and larger power pellets. This imagery serves to visually introduce players to the main characters and elements they will encounter in the game, emphasizing the objective to navigate Pac-Man through the maze while avoiding the ghosts and consuming the pellets.",
    "Figure2": "Illustration of a vibrant orange anthropomorphic character, resembling a round fruit with a pair of blue eyes, red lips, and a red bow on its head. The character is extending its arms outward, positioned between two black vertical panels with the word 'VIDEO GAMES' visible at the top. It stands above a dark circular platform, casting a shadow below it. The illustration may serve as a visual representation or mascot for the game, offering players a depiction of a game element or character to enhance their gaming experience.",
    "Figure3": "A detailed, top-down view of the Atari 2600 Pac-Man game maze. The maze is primarily blue with red paths for the characters to navigate. In the center, there's a large, enclosed area where ghosts are regenerated. Around the perimeter of the maze are four larger dots, which are power pellets that give Pac-Man the ability to eat the ghosts. The maze also has numerous small dots, which Pac-Man needs to consume to complete the level. On the bottom, two orange characters, possibly representing ghosts in their vulnerable state, are displayed.",
    "Figure4": "A game screen from the Atari 2600 version of 'Pacman'. The maze is presented in its iconic blue layout with orange walls and a dark background. Pac-Man, depicted as a yellow half-circle, is positioned towards the right-center of the maze. Above him, a single pink ghost is visible, indicating potential danger. On the far left and far right edges of the maze, there are tunnels marked as 'Tunnel', which Pac-Man can use to escape from pursuing ghosts and reappear on the opposite side of the screen. The purpose of these tunnels in gameplay is to provide strategic options for the player to evade ghosts and potentially ambush them from behind. At the bottom, there appears to be a score indicator, though the exact numbers are not clearly visible.",
    "Figure5": "A top-down view of a Pac-Man game maze on the Atari 2600. The maze is designed with deep blue walls, forming pathways that are filled with small white dots, representing the pellets Pac-Man must eat. There's a larger, orange-yellow figure in the center of the maze, representing Pac-Man, facing downward and positioned close to a larger pellet or power pellet. Above Pac-Man, there's a ghost with a hollowed, orange appearance, indicating it's vulnerable and can be eaten by Pac-Man after he consumes the power pellet. On the bottom of the screen, there are two orange symbols representing the lives left in the game. This visualization provides guidance on the maze layout, the positions of key elements like the power pellet, and the current status of the ghost and Pac-Man. This can be used to strategize gameplay, plan movement routes, and understand game mechanics.",
    "Figure6": "A screenshot of the Atari 2600 version of the 'Pac-Man' game. The game's maze is predominantly blue with a few pathways. The central box-shaped area, known as the 'ghost house', is positioned at the center of the maze. Four ghosts of different colors (red, pink, cyan, and orange) are seen inside and around the ghost house. To the bottom-left of the maze, Pac-Man, represented by a yellow circular shape with a section cut out to represent its mouth, is seen approaching a pellet. There are also two larger power-pellets, located at the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the maze. The bottom panel displays two orange icons resembling Pac-Man, likely representing the player's remaining lives. The player's score is displayed as '1130' on the center-right. This screenshot aids players by providing a visual representation of the game's layout, the positioning of ghosts, and Pac-Man's current location in relation to pellets and power-pellets."
