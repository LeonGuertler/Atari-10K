    "Figure1": "The image depicts a labeled diagram of the gameplay screen from the Atari 2600 game, Breakout. The diagram showcases various elements of the game interface:\n\nScoreboard/Timer: Located at the top-left corner of the screen, displaying the score as '005.' This area likely shows the player's score or the time elapsed, essential for tracking game progress.\nBalls/Game Numbers: Located at the top-right corner, it displays the number '3.' This likely indicates the number of balls or lives remaining for the player, crucial for understanding the state of gameplay.\nNumber of Players/Team Numbers: Positioned right beneath the Balls/Game Numbers, it displays the number '1.' This probably represents the current player's number or team number, which would be significant in games with multiple participants.\nBrick Wall: A prominent multi-colored strip running horizontally across the screen's upper mid-section. This is the main target in the game. Players aim to eliminate these bricks by hitting them with the ball. The variety of colors might denote different point values or require multiple hits to break.\nBall: A small red dot, found near the bottom center of the screen. This ball bounces off the paddle, walls, and bricks. The main objective is to keep this ball in play while trying to break the bricks above.\nPaddle: A horizontal red bar at the screen's bottom. The player controls this paddle, moving it left or right to hit the bouncing ball. Proper positioning of the paddle is key to directing the ball towards desired bricks and preventing it from falling off the screen, which could result in the loss of a life.",
    "Figure2": "This image illustrates a graphic representation of the 'Breakout' game on the Atari 2600 console as described in the game's manual. The screen is framed within a retro-style television or monitor. On the display, there is a section at the top labeled 'SCOREBOARD/TIMER,' which shows the numbers '055 4 1.' These numbers, from left to right, likely represent the player's score, game number or mode, and the number of players or teams participating.\n\nBelow the scoreboard, the primary game area consists of a multi-colored 'BRICK WALL' at the top. Each brick appears as a horizontal bar, and the colors (from top to bottom) are yellow, green, light blue, and orange. Situated just below the wall, there's a moving 'BALL,' depicted by a small square, which is currently in motion as indicated by the dashed trajectory line. The objective of the game is to use the 'PADDLE' at the bottom of the screen, represented by a horizontal red bar, to hit the ball and break the bricks.\n\nAs the player controls the paddle to keep the ball in play, the ball will bounce off the walls, bricks, and paddle. Successfully hitting the bricks with the ball will result in the bricks disappearing, and the player's score will increase. The main gameplay challenge is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball pass the paddle and hit the bottom edge of the screen. The annotations provided in the image serve as a guide for new players to understand the game's primary elements and mechanics."
