    "Figure1": "An annotated screenshot from the Atari 2600 game 'Frostbite.' The game display showcases an icy environment with various game elements. Starting from the top, we see a 'Score' indicator followed by 'Reserve Frostbites.' A 'Polar Grizzly' is seen walking on the ice at the top. As we move downwards, we find an 'Igloo' on the far right side, which is the player's primary objective. The middle section features 'Killer Clams,' 'Ice Blocks,' 'Fish,' and 'Snow Geese' that the player must avoid or interact with to score points. There's also an 'Alaskan King Crab' at the bottom left. The main player character is labeled 'Frostbite Bailey,' positioned towards the lower-middle of the screen. He appears to be standing on a floating ice block. On the bottom-most part of the image, there are two joystick controllers, representing the game controls. The temperature is also displayed on the left side. These annotations aid in understanding game mechanics and objectives, such as collecting ice blocks to build the igloo while avoiding hazards.",
    "Figure2": "An illustrated graphic from the Atari 2600 'Frostbite' game manual. The image displays a central cartoon character named 'Frostbite Bailey' standing atop a white igloo. Frostbite Bailey appears as a white bear-like figure with black goggles and a red collar. Above him, a bird, possibly a seagull, is in flight, and to the side of the igloo, a red crab is depicted attempting to climb it. The title 'FROSTBITE BAILEY'S' is printed in bold above the igloo, and the words 'ARCTIC ARCHITECTS' are shown below the igloo, hinting at the game's theme of constructing structures in an arctic environment. The blue backdrop, which frames the entire scene, has the word 'ACTIVISION' inscribed in the top left corner. This visual likely serves as a reference guide to some of the game's characters and challenges, providing players with a visual representation of the game's arctic setting and potential obstacles.",
    "Figure3": "The image showcases a man with dark hair and a beard, wearing a thick jacket with the collar turned up. He has his arms crossed, presumably for warmth. The surroundings appear cold and the backdrop suggests an outdoor setting, possibly icy or snowy terrain. This image could represent the protagonist or a guide for the game 'Frostbite' on Atari 2600, emphasizing the chilly environment and the need for warmth, which might play a role in the game's mechanics or objectives. The player might need to consider strategies related to surviving or navigating through cold conditions in the game.",
