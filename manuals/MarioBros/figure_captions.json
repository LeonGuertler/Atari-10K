    "Figure2": "Image depicts four enemies from the Atari 2600 game 'Mario Bros.' Each enemy is positioned inside a green pipe. From left to right:\nShellcreeper: A turtle-like creature with a shell pattern, wearing purple shades. It poses potential threats to Mario or Luigi by crawling from pipes.\nSidestepper: A red crab with two large pincers and a wide grin, showcasing its sharp teeth. Players may need to hit it twice to flip it over.\nFighter Fly: A fly with large round eyes and purple wings. It hops around the platforms, making it a tricky target for Mario or Luigi.\nSlipice: A melancholic looking ice creature that resembles a droplet. It has the ability to freeze platforms, making them slippery for Mario or Luigi.\n\nThe text fragment visible in the image mentions a button action when Mario or Luigi is standing still, suggesting that players might need to use a specific button to interact or defend against these enemies when not in motion.",
