    "Figure1": "An image depicting a large, cracked, oval-shaped object resembling an egg, glowing brightly from a split at its center, positioned against a dark, starry space background. Below the egg is a landscape with fractured patterns, resembling dried and cracked ground. A caption below the landscape reads, 'In space no one can hear you scream.'
